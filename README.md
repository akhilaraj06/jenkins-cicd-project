Designed and implemented a fully automated CI/CD pipeline for a Java application, integrating modern DevOps tools to ensure efficient, scalable, and robust deployment to Kubernetes clusters.
Key Responsibilities & Contributions:

Built a Jenkins declarative pipeline for continuous integration:

Automated build, unit tests, static code analysis (SonarQube), and Docker image creation.

Configured webhook triggers for automatic pipeline execution on Git commits/pull requests.

Integrated continuous delivery using Argo CD:

Implemented GitOps workflow with separate Git repository for Kubernetes manifests.

Used Argo Image Updater to automatically update manifests with new container image versions.

Ensured automated and version-controlled deployment to test and production environments.

Ensured code quality and security:

Used SonarQube for static code analysis and security checks.

Containerization and deployment:

Created Docker images and pushed to a container registry (Docker Hub/ECR).

Deployed applications as Kubernetes pods using Helm charts.

Documented the complete architecture and workflow for team understanding and future scalability.

Tools & Technologies Used:
Jenkins | Maven | SonarQube | Docker | Kubernetes | Helm | Argo CD | Argo Image Updater | Git/GitHub | JUnit/Mockito | Slack/Email Notifications

Outcome / Impact:

Reduced manual deployment effort, enabling fully automated CI/CD from code commit to production.

Ensured faster, reliable releases with proper monitoring and rollback capabilities.

Demonstrated strong understanding of modern DevOps practices, CI/CD pipelines, and GitOps workflows.
